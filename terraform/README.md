# CDKTF Infrastructure Components and Constructs

This repository hosts a comprehensive collection of CDKTF (Cloud Development Kit for Terraform) components and constructs for AWS and Azure cloud platforms. It serves as a practical toolkit for individuals keen on mastering infrastructure automation, CI/CD processes, and multi-cloud strategies.

## Overview

Our components and constructs are designed to be modular and reusable, enabling efficient setup of complex cloud infrastructure elements across AWS and Azure. They embody infrastructure-as-code (IaC) best practices and are perfect for learning and applying CI/CD and automation techniques in real-world scenarios.
